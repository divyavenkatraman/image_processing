To use GUI, run GraphicsMain. Window will be empty until you load an image. All possible image filtering operations are in the dropdown menus on the top. Click the operation, and if prompted for an input, type one in. Typing in a negative number for the brighten operation will darken the image. Trying to brighten an image that has not been loaded, trying to load an incorrect file type, and giving an invalid input when prompted for one will (surprisingly) not work, but will not cause the program to break. The histogram will self adjust in scale whenever the image is changed so all values always fit in the panel but no graph looks too tiny. Simply close the window to quit the program. All operations required by the assignment are supported.
